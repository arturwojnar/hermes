<!-- The type is a simple wrapper to ensure the structure's correctness. It defines:

- **type** - event type name,
- **data** - represents the business data the event contains. It has to be a record structure; primitives are not allowed,
- **metadata** - represents the generic data event contains. It can represent telemetry, user id, tenant id, timestamps and other information that can be useful for running infrastructure. It has to be a record structure; primitives are not allowed. -->
